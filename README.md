# Typehole ðŸ•³

Bring your runtime values an inch closer to your type definitions.

Generate TypeScript interfaces for API requests and other unknown types at runtime based on actual values. So kind of like [Quicktype](https://app.quicktype.io/) or [json2ts](http://json2ts.com/), but without having to copy-paste JSON and typescript interfaces around. This plugin is still very experimental, so please expect and report issues.
