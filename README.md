Automatically generate TypeScript types and interfaces for all serializable runtime values.

Typehole is a TypeScript development tool for Visual Studio Code that automates creating static typing by bridging runtime values from your Node.js or browser application to your code editor. It's useful when you need types for an API response or want to figure out types for values coming from a JS module.

## Installation

Install the [Visual Studio Code - extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rikurouvila.typehole). No additional build tooling or compiler plugins are needed.

## How does it work?

1. Find an `any` / `unknown` value you need an interface for

```typescript
const response = await axios.get("https://reddit.com/r/typescript.json");
const data /* any */ = response.data;
```

2. Place the value inside a typehole by selecting an expression and opening the **Quick Fix** menu by pressing âŒ˜ + . (macOS) or ctrl + . (Windows) and selecting **Add a typehole**.

```typescript
type RedditResponse = any; // Type placeholder inserted by the extension
const response = await axios.get("https://reddit.com/r/typescript.json");

const data: RedditResponse = typehole.t(response.data);
```

3. Run your code either in a browser or in Node.js. Typehole runtime captures the value and sends it back to your code editor. The VSCode extension records the captured value, turns all the values from that typehole into an interface and inserts it into the same module.

```typescript
interface RedditResponse {
  /* âœ¨ Actual fields and types are automatically generated âœ¨ */
}

const response = await axios.get("https://reddit.com/r/typescript.json");
const data: RedditResponse = typehole.t(response.data);
```

3. Remove the typehole, and you're done. Typeholes are meant to be development-time only, so you shouldn't commit them. Typehole provides you with 2 [commands](#Commands) for easy removal of typeholes.

```typescript
interface RedditResponse {
  /* âœ¨ Actual fields and types are automatically generated âœ¨ */
}

const response = await axios.get("https://reddit.com/r/typescript.json");
const data: RedditResponse = response.data;
```

This plugin is still very experimental, so please expect and report issues.

## Features

- Generate TypeScript types from runtime values
- Run the code many times with different values thus augmenting your types<br/><br/><img width="500" src="./images/samples.gif" />

- Wrap values automatically to typeholes with a code action<br/><br/><img width="500" src="./images/code-action.png" />

### Values that can be automatically typed

All primitive values and values that are JSON serializable.

- Booleans
- Numbers
- Strings
- Arrays
- Objects
- null

So all values you can receive as an HTTP request payload can be turned into an interface.

From 1.4.0 forward also Promises are supported. All other values (functions etc.) will be typed as `any`.

## Commands

- Starting and stopping the server manually isn't necessary by default. The server starts once you add your first typehole.

## Extension Settings

| Setting                         | Type        | Default | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| typehole.runtime.autoInstall    | boolean     | true    | Install Typehole runtime package automatically when the first typehole is added |
| typehole.runtime.projectPath    | string      |         | Project directory where Typehole runtime should be installed                    |
| typehole.runtime.packageManager | npm \| yarn | npm     | Package manager to be used when installing the runtime                          |

## Known Issues

- Typehole server cannot be running in 2 VSCode editors at the same time as the server port is hard-coded to 17341

## Release Notes

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2021-05-15

### Added

- Support for inferring Promises ðŸ‘€

### Fixed

- Runtime now installed also on startup if there are typeholes in your code
- No more duplicate AutoDiscoveredN types

## [1.4.1] - 2021-05-09

### Fixed

- Unserializable diagnostic now shown only once per typehole. Previously the tooltip could have the same warning multiple times.

- Server is now stopped once all typeholes are removed. Restarting the server now also works

### Added

## [1.4.0] - 2021-05-09

### Added

- Sample collection. Provide multiple different values to a typehole and the generated type gets refined based on them.

## [1.3.0] - 2021-05-08

### Added

- Configuration options for project path, package manager and if runtime should be automatically installed

## [1.1.0] - 2021-05-08

### Added
